## Day of Datomic

The Day of Datomic project is a collection of samples and tutorials
for learning [Datomic](http://datomic.com) at a Clojure REPL.


## Getting Started

First, download and install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org), the
Clojure build tool.

Then run a REPL:

On Unix-like systems, including Mac OS X:

    lein repl

On Windows:

    lein.bat repl


# Tutorials

Work through some of the tutorials in the tutorial directory,
evaluating each form at the REPL. You might start with:

* hello_world.clj
* social_news.clj
* provenance.clj
* datalog_on_defrecords.clj
* data_functions.clj
* binding.clj
* graph.clj

You can also run all of the examples and see their output by running:

    lein run -m datomic.samples.tutorials


## Study the Samples

As or after you work through the tutorial, you may want to also study
the helper functions in src/datomic/samples.
